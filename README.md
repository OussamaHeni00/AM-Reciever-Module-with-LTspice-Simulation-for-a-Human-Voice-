# AM-Reciever-Module-with-LTspice-Simulation-for-a-Human-Voice-
This aim of this Project is building an AM Reciever Circuit and Simulate the Carrier Wave for a Human Voice Modulated of 1.5 Mhz in LTspice as a Carrier Wave and extract the real Voice into a .Wav File to Simulate Input/Output of a Radio
